Vector Search for Semantic Book Recommendations

This module saves the tagged descriptions (ISBN + description) from the cleaned data into a text file,
builds a vector store using LangChainâ€™s Chroma (with OpenAI embeddings),
and defines a function to retrieve semantic recommendations based on a user query.
An example demonstration is provided when the module is run directly.
