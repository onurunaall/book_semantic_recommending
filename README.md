# Semantic Book Recommender

This is a semantic book recommendation project I built to learn how to work with data, machine learning models, and build a simple user interface. The idea is to let users describe a book theyâ€™re interested in, and the app tries to recommend books that match that description in meaning and mood.

It uses book metadata and descriptions, applies some filtering and cleanup, then classifies books, scores their emotions, and finally allows the user to search semantically through a simple Gradio dashboard.
